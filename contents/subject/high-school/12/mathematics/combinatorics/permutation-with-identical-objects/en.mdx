## Understanding Permutation with Identical Objects

**Permutation with identical objects** is an arrangement of objects where there are several objects that are identical or the same. When there are identical objects, the number of different arrangements will decrease because **exchanging identical objects does not produce new arrangements**.

Imagine arranging letters from the word "MAMA". Although there are 4 letters, we cannot distinguish between the first M and the second M, or the first A and the second A. As a result, arrangements that look different but use the same letters in different positions are considered identical.

## Formula for Identical Object Permutation

For permutation of n objects where there are identical objects, **the formula used** is:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="P = \frac{n!}{r_1! \times r_2! \times r_3! \times \cdots \times r_k!}" />
</div>

**Explanation:**

- <InlineMath math="n" /> = total number of objects
- <InlineMath math="r_1, r_2, r_3, \ldots, r_k" /> = number of identical objects in each group
- <InlineMath math="k" /> = number of groups of identical objects

**How to identify identical objects**: Count how many times each object appears in the entire arrangement, not just looking at different objects.

## Application to Words and Letters

### Example Word KALIMANTAN

Let's calculate how many letter arrangements can be made from the word "KALIMANTAN".

**Systematic identification steps:**
Write letters one by one: K-A-L-I-M-A-N-T-A-N

Total letters: 10

Letter identification: K appears 1 time, A appears 3 times (positions 2, 6, 9), L appears 1 time, I appears 1 time, M appears 1 time, N appears 2 times (positions 7, 10), T appears 1 time

**Calculation:**

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="P = \frac{10!}{1! \times 3! \times 1! \times 1! \times 1! \times 2! \times 1!}" />
<BlockMath math="= \frac{10!}{3! \times 2!}" />
<BlockMath math="= \frac{3628800}{6 \times 2} = \frac{3628800}{12}" />
<BlockMath math="= 302400 \text{ arrangements}" />
</div>

### Example Word PALAPA

For the word "PALAPA" with 6 letters:
Write letters one by one: P-A-L-A-P-A

**Letter identification:** P appears 2 times (positions 1, 5), A appears 3 times (positions 2, 4, 6), L appears 1 time

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="P = \frac{6!}{2! \times 3! \times 1!}" />
<BlockMath math="= \frac{720}{2 \times 6 \times 1} = \frac{720}{12}" />
<BlockMath math="= 60 \text{ arrangements}" />
</div>

## Systematic Calculation Steps

To solve permutation problems with identical objects, follow these steps:

1. **Count total objects**: Determine the value of n
2. **Identify identical objects**: Group objects that are identical
3. **Count frequency**: Determine how many times each object appears
4. **Apply formula**: Insert into the permutation formula
5. **Calculate factorial**: Complete the calculation carefully

### Word BANANA

Let's apply these steps to find arrangements of the word "BANANA":

**Step 1: Count total objects**

Write letters one by one: B-A-N-A-N-A

Total letters: <InlineMath math="n = 6" />

**Step 2: Identify identical objects**

Group identical letters together:
- B group: B
- A group: A, A, A  
- N group: N, N

**Step 3: Count frequency**

Count how many times each letter appears:
- B appears 1 time
- A appears 3 times
- N appears 2 times

**Step 4: Apply formula**

Use the permutation formula with identical objects:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="P = \frac{n!}{r_1! \times r_2! \times r_3!}" />
<BlockMath math="P = \frac{6!}{1! \times 3! \times 2!}" />
</div>

**Step 5: Calculate factorial**

Calculate each factorial value:
- <InlineMath math="6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720" />
- <InlineMath math="1! = 1" />
- <InlineMath math="3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6" />
- <InlineMath math="2! = 2 \times 1 = 2" />

Calculation:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="P = \frac{720}{1 \times 6 \times 2} = \frac{720}{12} = 60" />
</div>

Therefore, the word "BANANA" can be arranged in **60 different ways**.

## Difference from Regular Permutation

**Regular permutation**: All objects are different, using formula <InlineMath math="n!" />

**Permutation with identical objects**: There are identical objects, using formula:

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="\frac{n!}{r_1! \times r_2! \times \cdots \times r_k!}" />
</div>

**Comparison example:**

Arranging letters A, B, C, D (all different): <InlineMath math="4! = 24" /> ways

Arranging letters A, A, B, C (some identical): 

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<BlockMath math="\frac{4!}{2!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ ways}" />
</div>

Identical objects **reduce** the number of arrangements because exchanging identical objects does not produce differences.

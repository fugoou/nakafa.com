## About The Project

**Nakafa** is an open-source educational platform dedicated to democratizing knowledge and making learning accessible to everyone, everywhere. Our core mission is to provide high-quality, comprehensive educational content across a wide spectrum of subjects and topics. We cater to learners of all ages and levels, from elementary school fundamentals to advanced university-level material, alongside insightful articles on current affairs and diverse topics of interest.

The name "Nakafa" (ŸÜÿßŸÅÿπÿ©) is an Arabic word meaning "beneficial" or "useful." It embodies our commitment to creating a platform that empowers individuals through education, transcending geographical, linguistic, and socio-economic barriers.

We believe that education is a fundamental right, and Nakafa aims to be a valuable resource for self-learners, educators, and anyone passionate about acquiring knowledge.

## Project Architecture & DeepWiki

For those interested in the technical "behind-the-scenes" of Nakafa, we maintain a detailed breakdown of our project architecture, design choices, and development process on DeepWiki. This serves as a living document that provides a deeper understanding of how Nakafa is built and how its various components interact.

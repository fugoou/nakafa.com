## Overdetermined Linear Equation Systems

Imagine we are trying to fit a curve to a set of data. 
In many practical cases, we have more data than parameters we want to find. 
Such situations create what is called **overdetermined linear equation systems**.

This system has a special characteristic. The number of equations is greater than the number of unknown variables. 
Mathematically, if we have <InlineMath math="m" /> equations and <InlineMath math="n" /> variables, 
then the condition <InlineMath math="m > n" /> makes this system "overdetermined".

## Real Example with Quadratic Polynomial Model

Let's look at a concrete example. Suppose we have <InlineMath math="7" /> data points that we want to fit 
with a parabola or quadratic curve.

The data we have is as follows.

| <InlineMath math="i" /> | <InlineMath math="1" /> | <InlineMath math="2" /> | <InlineMath math="3" /> | <InlineMath math="4" /> | <InlineMath math="5" /> | <InlineMath math="6" /> | <InlineMath math="7" /> |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| <InlineMath math="t_i" /> | <InlineMath math="-3" /> | <InlineMath math="-2" /> | <InlineMath math="-1" /> | <InlineMath math="0" /> | <InlineMath math="1" /> | <InlineMath math="2" /> | <InlineMath math="3" /> |
| <InlineMath math="y_i" /> | <InlineMath math="-2.2" /> | <InlineMath math="-4.2" /> | <InlineMath math="-4.2" /> | <InlineMath math="-1.8" /> | <InlineMath math="1.8" /> | <InlineMath math="8.2" /> | <InlineMath math="15.8" /> |

We want to find a parabola with the following form.

<BlockMath math="y = a_2 \cdot t^2 + a_1 \cdot t + a_0" />

Here we are looking for <InlineMath math="3" /> parameters, namely <InlineMath math="a_2" /> (quadratic coefficient), 
<InlineMath math="a_1" /> (linear coefficient), and <InlineMath math="a_0" /> (constant).

## Setting Up the System of Equations

Now, how do we use this data to find the parabola parameters? 
The idea is simple. For each data point, we can write one equation. 
With <InlineMath math="7" /> data points, we will get <InlineMath math="7" /> equations.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot (-3)^2 + a_1 \cdot (-3) + a_0 = -2.2" />
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot (-2)^2 + a_1 \cdot (-2) + a_0 = -4.2" />
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot (-1)^2 + a_1 \cdot (-1) + a_0 = -4.2" />
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot 0^2 + a_1 \cdot 0 + a_0 = -1.8" />
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot 1^2 + a_1 \cdot 1 + a_0 = 1.8" />
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot 2^2 + a_1 \cdot 2 + a_0 = 8.2" />
<BlockMath math="a_2 \cdot 3^2 + a_1 \cdot 3 + a_0 = 15.8" />
</MathContainer>

Now let's calculate the square values for each <InlineMath math="t_i" />. 
For example, for <InlineMath math="t_1 = -3" />, we have <InlineMath math="(-3)^2 = 9" />. 
Similarly for the others. After calculating everything, our equations become like this.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="9a_2 - 3a_1 + a_0 = -2.2" />
<BlockMath math="4a_2 - 2a_1 + a_0 = -4.2" />
<BlockMath math="1a_2 - 1a_1 + a_0 = -4.2" />
<BlockMath math="0a_2 + 0a_1 + a_0 = -1.8" />
<BlockMath math="1a_2 + 1a_1 + a_0 = 1.8" />
<BlockMath math="4a_2 + 2a_1 + a_0 = 8.2" />
<BlockMath math="9a_2 + 3a_1 + a_0 = 15.8" />
</MathContainer>

## Matrix Form

The system of equations above can be written in matrix form <InlineMath math="A \cdot x = b" />.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\begin{pmatrix} 9 & -3 & 1 \\ 4 & -2 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 4 & 2 & 1 \\ 9 & 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a_2 \\ a_1 \\ a_0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2.2 \\ -4.2 \\ -4.2 \\ -1.8 \\ 1.8 \\ 8.2 \\ 15.8 \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

In general, for a quadratic polynomial model with <InlineMath math="m" /> data points, 
the matrix form is as follows.

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\begin{pmatrix} t_1^2 & t_1 & 1 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ t_m^2 & t_m & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} a_2 \\ a_1 \\ a_0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

## Why There Is No Exact Solution

Now we face an interesting situation. In our example, matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> has size <InlineMath math="7 \times 3" /> 
and vector <InlineMath math="x" /> has size <InlineMath math="3 \times 1" />. 
This means we have <InlineMath math="7" /> equations but only <InlineMath math="3" /> unknown variables.

Does this mean the system cannot be solved? Let's examine this more deeply.

The three columns of matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> are linearly independent, so the rank of matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> is <InlineMath math="3" />. 
However, when we add vector <InlineMath math="b" /> to matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> 
to form the augmented matrix <InlineMath math="(A|b)" />, its rank becomes <InlineMath math="4" />.

This condition tells us something important. This system **has no exact solution**. 
In simple terms, there is no single parabola that can pass through all <InlineMath math="7" /> data points perfectly.

## Solution with Least Squares

So what should we do? Give up? Of course not! 

When an overdetermined linear equation system has no exact solution, 
we use the **least squares** approach. The basic idea makes perfect sense. 
If we cannot find a parabola that passes through all points, 
let's find the parabola that is "closest" to all points.

Mathematically, this method seeks parameters that minimize the sum of squared differences 
between predicted values and observed values. Imagine we draw a parabola, 
then measure the vertical distance from each data point to that parabola. 
The least squares method finds the parabola that makes the total squared distances as small as possible.

> Overdetermined linear equation systems are very common in the real world, 
> especially when we have many measurement data but a relatively simple model.

The least squares approach provides an optimal solution in the sense of minimizing 
overall error, making it very practical for engineering and scientific applications.

## Basic Concepts of Determinant

Determinant is a very important mathematical tool in linear algebra. Think of determinant as a "strength" measure of a matrix, it tells us how much change a space undergoes when transformed by that matrix.

Every square matrix has one unique determinant value. This value can be positive, negative, or zero, and each tells us different information about the matrix.

Determinant is a special function that takes a square matrix and produces one real number:

<BlockMath math="\det : \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \to \mathbb{R} : A \mapsto \det A" />

This function is unique because it has three characteristic properties that no other function has.

## Three Determining Properties of Determinant

### Linear Property on Each Row

Determinant is **linear** on each row of the matrix. This means, if we change one row, the determinant will change linearly.

When we add two vectors in one row:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_i + a_i' \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix} = \det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_i \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="+ \det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_i' \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

When we multiply one row by a scalar:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ \lambda \cdot a_i \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="= \lambda \cdot \det \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ \vdots \\ a_i \\ \vdots \\ a_n \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

### Antisymmetric Property

Determinant is **antisymmetric**, if there are two identical rows, the determinant immediately becomes zero:

<BlockMath math="\det \begin{pmatrix} \vdots \\ a \\ \vdots \\ a \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix} = 0" />

This makes sense because if two rows are the same, the matrix cannot have full rank.

### Normalization Property

Determinant is **normalized** so that the determinant of the identity matrix is always 1:

<BlockMath math="\det I = 1" />

Where <InlineMath math="I" /> is an identity matrix of any size.

## Matrix Operations and Determinant

If we multiply the entire matrix by a scalar <InlineMath math="\lambda" />, the determinant will be affected by the power of n:

<BlockMath math="\det(\lambda A) = \lambda^n \cdot \det A" />

This is because each row is multiplied by <InlineMath math="\lambda" />, and there are <InlineMath math="n" /> total rows.

When we swap two rows of a matrix, the determinant changes sign:

<BlockMath math="\det B = -\det A" />

Interestingly, when we add a multiple of one row to another row, the determinant doesn't change:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det \begin{pmatrix} \vdots \\ a_j \\ \vdots \\ a_i + \lambda a_j \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="= \det \begin{pmatrix} \vdots \\ a_j \\ \vdots \\ a_i \\ \vdots \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

Multiplying a row by scalar <InlineMath math="\lambda \neq 0" /> changes the determinant to <InlineMath math="\det A' = \lambda \cdot \det A" />. Swapping rows changes the sign to <InlineMath math="\det A' = -\det A" />. Adding multiples of other rows doesn't change the determinant at all.

## Relationship with Matrix Invertibility

Determinant is key to understanding whether a matrix can be inverted. For a square matrix A, the following conditions are equivalent:

1. **Matrix A is invertible**
2. **There exists an inverse matrix** <InlineMath math="A^{-1}" /> that satisfies <InlineMath math="AA^{-1} = I" />
3. **Full rank matrix**: <InlineMath math="\text{rank}(A) = n" />
4. **Trivial kernel**: <InlineMath math="\ker(A) = \{0\}" />
5. **Columns are linearly independent**
6. **Rows are linearly independent**
7. **Determinant is not zero**: <InlineMath math="\det A \neq 0" />

> If the determinant is zero, the matrix "flattens" space to a lower dimension, so the transformation cannot be inverted.

If the rows of a matrix are linearly dependent, the determinant must be zero. This happens because of the antisymmetric property of determinant, linear dependence creates a situation where we can make identical rows through linear operations.

## Multiplication Properties and Similar Matrices

One of the most useful properties of determinant is how it interacts with matrix multiplication:

<BlockMath math="\det(AB) = \det A \cdot \det B" />

If matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> is invertible, the determinant of its inverse is:

<BlockMath math="\det(A^{-1}) = \frac{1}{\det A}" />

Two matrices <InlineMath math="A" /> and <InlineMath math="B" /> are called **similar** if there exists an invertible matrix <InlineMath math="S" /> such that:

<BlockMath math="B = S^{-1}AS" />

Similar matrices have the same determinant. The proof is simple:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det B = \det(S^{-1}AS)" />
<BlockMath math="= \det(S^{-1}) \cdot \det A \cdot \det S" />
<BlockMath math="= \frac{1}{\det S} \cdot \det A \cdot \det S = \det A" />
</MathContainer>

When performing Gaussian elimination with <InlineMath math="p" /> row swaps, the determinant of the resulting matrix <InlineMath math="R" /> is:

<BlockMath math="\det R = (-1)^p \cdot \det A" />

This provides a practical method for calculating determinants.

## Common Mistakes About Determinant

It's important to remember that determinant is **not** additive:

<BlockMath math="\det(A + B) \neq \det A + \det B" />

As a simple example:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det\left(\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}\right)" />
<BlockMath math="= \det\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix} = 4" />
</MathContainer>

But:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} + \det\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="= 1 + 1 = 2" />
</MathContainer>

Clearly <InlineMath math="4 \neq 2" />, so determinant is not additive on matrix addition.

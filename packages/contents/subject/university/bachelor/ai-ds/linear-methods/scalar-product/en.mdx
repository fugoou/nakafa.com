## Definition of Scalar Product

A scalar product is a fundamental operation that allows us to compute the "multiplication" between two vectors with the result being a scalar number. Through every positive definite matrix, we can define a scalar product on vector spaces.

A scalar product on complex vector space <InlineMath math="\mathbb{C}^n" /> is a sesquilinear Hermitian form that is positive definite with three main properties.

### Sesquilinear Property

For all vectors <InlineMath math="x, y, z \in \mathbb{C}^n" /> and scalars <InlineMath math="\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{C}" />, the scalar product satisfies:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\langle \lambda x + \mu y, z \rangle_A = \overline{\lambda} \langle x, z \rangle_A + \overline{\mu} \langle y, z \rangle_A" />
<BlockMath math="\langle x, \lambda y + \mu z \rangle_A = \lambda \langle x, y \rangle_A + \mu \langle x, z \rangle_A" />
</MathContainer>

This property is called sesquilinear because it is semilinear in the first argument and linear in the second argument.

### Hermitian Property

For all vectors <InlineMath math="x, y \in \mathbb{C}^n" />, the following holds:

<BlockMath math="\langle y, x \rangle_A = \overline{\langle x, y \rangle_A}" />

### Positive Definite Property

For all vectors <InlineMath math="x \in \mathbb{C}^n" />, the following holds:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\langle x, x \rangle_A \geq 0" />
<BlockMath math="\langle x, x \rangle_A = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 0" />
</MathContainer>

Thus, a scalar product is a sesquilinear Hermitian form that is positive definite on <InlineMath math="\mathbb{C}^n" />.

## Scalar Product on Real Space

If <InlineMath math="A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}" /> is a positive definite matrix, then the mapping:

<BlockMath math="\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_A : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} : (x, y) \mapsto \langle x, y \rangle_A = x^T A y" />

has the following properties:

1. **Bilinear**: For all vectors <InlineMath math="x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}^n" /> and scalars <InlineMath math="\lambda, \mu \in \mathbb{R}" />, the following holds:

    <MathContainer>
    <BlockMath math="\langle \lambda x + \mu y, z \rangle_A = \lambda \langle x, z \rangle_A + \mu \langle y, z \rangle_A" />
    <BlockMath math="\langle x, \lambda y + \mu z \rangle_A = \lambda \langle x, y \rangle_A + \mu \langle x, z \rangle_A" />
    </MathContainer>

    This property is called bilinear because it is linear in both arguments.

2. **Symmetric**: For all vectors <InlineMath math="x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n" />, the following holds:

    <BlockMath math="\langle y, x \rangle_A = \langle x, y \rangle_A" />

3. **Positive Definite**: For all vectors <InlineMath math="x \in \mathbb{R}^n" />, the following holds:

    <MathContainer>
    <BlockMath math="\langle x, x \rangle_A \geq 0" />
    <BlockMath math="\langle x, x \rangle_A = 0 \Leftrightarrow x = 0" />
    </MathContainer>

    Thus, a scalar product is a symmetric bilinear form that is positive definite on <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" />.

## Scalar Product on Complex Space

Generalization to complex space involves the important role of complex conjugate. If <InlineMath math="A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}" /> is a positive definite matrix, then the mapping:

<BlockMath math="\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle_A : \mathbb{C}^n \times \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C} : (x, y) \mapsto \langle x, y \rangle_A = x^H A y" />

has the same properties as the general definition above, namely sesquilinear in the first argument, linear in the second argument, Hermitian with complex conjugate, and positive definite.

This shows that when we move to complex space, the complex conjugate plays an important role in maintaining a consistent scalar product structure.

## Matrix Representation

An important result in scalar product theory is that every scalar product can be expressed in the form of an appropriate matrix.

Every scalar product <InlineMath math="s(x, y)" /> on <InlineMath math="\mathbb{R}^n" /> as well as on <InlineMath math="\mathbb{C}^n" /> can be expressed in the form:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="s(x, y) = x^T A y \text{ (for real case)}" />
<BlockMath math="s(x, y) = x^H A y \text{ (for complex case)}" />
</MathContainer>

through an appropriate positive definite matrix <InlineMath math="A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}" /> or <InlineMath math="A \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times n}" />.

The elements of matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> can be computed as:

<BlockMath math="a_{ij} = s(e_i, e_j) \text{ for } i, j = 1, \ldots, n" />

where <InlineMath math="e_i" /> is the standard basis vector.

## Example of Standard Scalar Product

The simplest example is the standard scalar product that uses the identity matrix <InlineMath math="I" />.

The standard scalar product is defined as:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\langle x, y \rangle = x^T y \text{ (for real case)}" />
<BlockMath math="\langle x, y \rangle = x^H y \text{ (for complex case)}" />
</MathContainer>

This standard scalar product is obtained by using the identity matrix as its representation matrix, so that all required properties are satisfied naturally.

> Through the relationship between scalar products and positive definite matrices, we can construct various types of scalar products that suit specific application needs.

## What is the Laplace Expansion Theorem?

The Laplace Expansion Theorem provides a way to calculate the determinant of a matrix by breaking it down into determinants of smaller matrices. This method is very useful because it allows us to calculate determinants of large matrices systematically.

This theorem provides flexibility in choosing which row or column to use for expansion, so we can choose the most advantageous one for calculation.

## Theorem Statement

For matrix <InlineMath math="A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}" />, the determinant can be calculated in two ways:

### Column-Based Expansion

Besides expansion based on column <InlineMath math="j" />, the determinant can be calculated using the formula:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det A = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (-1)^{i+j} \cdot a_{ij} \cdot \det A_{ij}" />
</MathContainer>

for any chosen column <InlineMath math="j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}" />.

### Row-Based Expansion

The determinant can also be calculated based on row <InlineMath math="i" />:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det A = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{i+j} \cdot a_{ij} \cdot \det A_{ij}" />
</MathContainer>

for any chosen row <InlineMath math="i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}" />.

## Expansion Examples

### 2×2 Matrix

For a matrix of size <InlineMath math="n = 2" />:

<BlockMath math="A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}" />

Expansion based on the first row:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det A = a_{11} \cdot \det(a_{22}) - a_{12} \cdot \det(a_{21})" />
<BlockMath math="= a_{11} \cdot a_{22} - a_{12} \cdot a_{21}" />
</MathContainer>

### 3×3 Matrix

For a matrix of size <InlineMath math="n = 3" />:

<BlockMath math="A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{pmatrix}" />

Expansion based on the first row:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det A = a_{11} \cdot \det \begin{pmatrix} a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{32} & a_{33} \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="- a_{12} \cdot \det \begin{pmatrix} a_{21} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{33} \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="+ a_{13} \cdot \det \begin{pmatrix} a_{21} & a_{22} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

After calculating the <InlineMath math="2 \times 2" /> determinants:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="= a_{11} \cdot (a_{22} \cdot a_{33} - a_{23} \cdot a_{32})" />
<BlockMath math="- a_{12} \cdot (a_{21} \cdot a_{33} - a_{23} \cdot a_{31})" />
<BlockMath math="+ a_{13} \cdot (a_{21} \cdot a_{32} - a_{22} \cdot a_{31})" />
</MathContainer>

If we expand it fully:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="= a_{11} \cdot a_{22} \cdot a_{33} - a_{11} \cdot a_{23} \cdot a_{32}" />
<BlockMath math="- a_{12} \cdot a_{21} \cdot a_{33} + a_{12} \cdot a_{23} \cdot a_{31}" />
<BlockMath math="+ a_{13} \cdot a_{21} \cdot a_{32} - a_{13} \cdot a_{22} \cdot a_{31}" />
</MathContainer>

## Sarrus Rule

The result of the <InlineMath math="3 \times 3" /> matrix expansion above corresponds to **Sarrus Rule**. This rule provides a visual way to calculate <InlineMath math="3 \times 3" /> determinants through diagonal patterns.

Sarrus formula for <InlineMath math="3 \times 3" /> matrices:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det A = a_{11}a_{22}a_{33} + a_{12}a_{23}a_{31} + a_{13}a_{21}a_{32}" />
<BlockMath math="- a_{13}a_{22}a_{31} - a_{11}a_{23}a_{32} - a_{12}a_{21}a_{33}" />
</MathContainer>

Sarrus rule uses diagonal patterns to determine which terms are added and which are subtracted.

## Computational Complexity

The complexity of determinant calculation using Laplace expansion is very high. For an <InlineMath math="n \times n" /> matrix, the number of multiplication operations required is:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="n \cdot (n-1) \cdot (n-2) \cdot \ldots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 \cdot (n-1)" />
<BlockMath math="= n! \cdot (n-1)" />
</MathContainer>

This shows that the algorithm complexity is factorial, which is very inefficient for large matrices.

## Utilizing Zero Elements

When a matrix has many zero elements, we can choose the expansion such that subdeterminants with zero elements do not need to be calculated. This can significantly reduce the computational burden.

### Optimization Example

Suppose we have a matrix:

<BlockMath math="A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 3 & 3 \\ 2 & 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}" />

Expansion based on the first row:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="\det A = 0 \cdot \det(\ldots) - 3 \cdot \det \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}" />
<BlockMath math="+ 3 \cdot \det \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}" />
</MathContainer>

Since the first element is zero, the calculation becomes:

<MathContainer>
<BlockMath math="= -3 \cdot (2 \cdot 1 - 0 \cdot 1) + 3 \cdot (2 \cdot 0 - 2 \cdot 1)" />
<BlockMath math="= -3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot (-2)" />
<BlockMath math="= -6 - 6 = -12" />
</MathContainer>

By choosing rows or columns that have many zeros, we can save calculations.

## Determinant of Transpose Matrix

One important property related to the Laplace theorem is:

<BlockMath math="\det A^T = \det A" />

This means the determinant of a matrix equals the determinant of its transpose.

### Consequences for Rows and Columns

Due to this transpose property, all determinant properties that apply to rows of matrix <InlineMath math="A" /> also apply to columns of matrix <InlineMath math="A" />.

For example:
- If two rows are identical then the determinant is zero, likewise if two columns are identical
- Swapping two rows changes the sign of the determinant, so does swapping two columns
- Elementary row operations and elementary column operations have the same effect on the determinant

## Larger Matrices

For matrices of size <InlineMath math="n = 4" /> and beyond, the principle of Laplace expansion still applies. However, the computational complexity becomes very high, so in practice other more efficient methods such as Gaussian elimination are often used.

The Laplace Expansion Theorem provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding determinant structure, although in practical applications it may be replaced by more efficient algorithms.

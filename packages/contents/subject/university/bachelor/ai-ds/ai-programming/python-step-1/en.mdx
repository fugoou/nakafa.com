## Introduction to Python

Python is a very popular and easy-to-learn programming language. Python is designed with a philosophy that prioritizes code readability, making it suitable for beginners who are new to programming.

Why is Python the favorite choice of many programmers? Python has syntax similar to everyday English, making it easy to understand. Imagine reading a recipe written in clear and easy-to-follow language. Additionally, Python is very powerful for various purposes, from web development, data analysis, machine learning, to artificial intelligence.

For more complete and in-depth information about Python, you can visit the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org). This documentation serves as the main reference source that is always updated with the latest Python features.

## Hello World Program

The tradition in learning programming is to create the first program that displays the text "Hello World!". This is a simple way to ensure Python is installed correctly and you're ready for coding.

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "hello.py",
    code: `print("Hello World!")`
  }]}
/>

The `print()` command is a built-in Python function used to display text or data to the screen. Whatever you write inside the parentheses will be displayed as output.

## Three Ways to Run Python Programs

There are three main ways to run Python code, each with different uses depending on your needs.

### Interactive Mode

Interactive mode allows you to write and run Python code directly in the terminal. This is very useful for testing simple code or quick experiments.

Here's how to use interactive mode. First open a terminal or command prompt, then type `python` or `python3` and press Enter. You'll see the `>>>` prompt indicating Python is ready to receive commands. Next, write Python code and press Enter to execute it.

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "bash",
    filename: "terminal",
    code: `$ python3
Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep  4 2020, 02:22:02) 
[Clang 10.0.0 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> name = "Alice"
>>> print(f"Hello, {name}!")
Hello, Alice!
>>>`
  }]}
/>

### Script Mode

Script mode is a way to run saved Python files. This is suitable for more complex programs or programs you want to save for repeated use.

The steps to run Python scripts are quite simple. First create a file with `.py` extension using a text editor, then write Python code inside the file and save it. After that, open a terminal and navigate to the folder where the file is saved, then run it with the command `python filename.py`.

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "greeting.py",
    code: `# Simple program to greet users
name = input("What's your name? ")
age = input("How old are you? ")

print(f"Hello {name}!")
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print("Happy learning Python!")`
  }]}
/>

To run the file above:

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "bash",
    filename: "terminal",
    code: `$ python3 greeting.py
What's your name? John
How old are you? 20
Hello John!
You are 20 years old.
Happy learning Python!`
  }]}
/>

### Jupyter Lab and Notebooks

Jupyter is an interactive environment very popular for data science and learning. Imagine Jupyter like a digital notebook that can run code. Jupyter allows you to write code, see results immediately, and add explanations in one document.

Jupyter has many advantages. You can run code per cell or section, output results are immediately visible below the code, you can add text explanations, images, and graphs, and it's ideal for experiments, data analysis, and learning.

Using Jupyter is quite easy. First install Jupyter via pip:

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "bash",
    filename: "terminal",
    code: `# Install jupyter
pip install jupyter

# Or install via Anaconda (recommended)
conda install jupyter`
  }]}
/>

Second, run Jupyter Lab:

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "bash",
    filename: "terminal",
    code: `# Run Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab

# Will open browser with Jupyter interface`
  }]}
/>

Third, create a new notebook with `.ipynb` extension and write code in cells, then press Shift+Enter to execute.

Example usage in Jupyter:

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "jupyter_example.ipynb",
    code: `# Cell 1: Import and setup
import math

# Cell 2: Variables and operations
radius = 5
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print(f"Circle area with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}")

# Cell 3: Create function
def calculate_circle_area(r):
    """Function to calculate circle area"""
    return math.pi * r ** 2

# Cell 4: Test function
test_radius = 7
result = calculate_circle_area(test_radius)
print(f"Circle area with radius {test_radius} is {result:.2f}")`
  }]}
/>

## Basic Python Syntax

Let's learn some basic Python concepts that you'll use frequently.

### Variables and Data Types

Python has several basic data types you need to understand. Variables in Python are like boxes that can store various types of data, and you can give labels or names to those boxes.

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "data_types.py",
    code: `# Basic data types in Python

# String (text)
name = "John Doe"
message = 'Hello Python!'

# Integer (whole numbers)
age = 25
year = 2025

# Float (decimal numbers)
height = 175.5
pi = 3.14159

# Boolean (True/False)
is_student = True
is_graduated = False

# List (list of items)
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "mango", "banana"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionary (key-value pairs)
person = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 22,
    "major": "Computer Science"
}

# Display data types
print(type(name))        # <class 'str'>
print(type(age))         # <class 'int'>
print(type(height))      # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student))  # <class 'bool'>
print(type(fruits))      # <class 'list'>
print(type(person))      # <class 'dict'>`
  }]}
/>

### Input and Output

User interaction is an important part of programming. Like a conversation, your program can ask users questions and provide answers or information.

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "input_output.py",
    code: `# Input from user
user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
user_age = input("Enter your age: ")

# Data type conversion
age_number = int(user_age)  # Convert string to integer

# Output with neat formatting
print(f"Hello {user_name}!")
print(f"You are {age_number} years old.")

# Mathematical operations
next_year = age_number + 1
print(f"Next year you will be {next_year} years old.")

# Output with different format
print("Name:", user_name)
print("Age:", age_number)
print("Age next year:", next_year)`
  }]}
/>

### Basic Mathematical Operations

Python supports various mathematical operations:

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "math_operations.py",
    code: `# Basic mathematical operations
a = 10
b = 3

# Arithmetic operations
addition = a + b      # 13
subtraction = a - b   # 7
multiplication = a * b # 30
division = a / b      # 3.333...
floor_division = a // b # 3 (division result rounded down)
modulus = a % b       # 1 (remainder)
exponent = a ** b     # 1000 (10 to the power of 3)

print(f"{a} + {b} = {addition}")
print(f"{a} - {b} = {subtraction}")
print(f"{a} * {b} = {multiplication}")
print(f"{a} / {b} = {division}")
print(f"{a} // {b} = {floor_division}")
print(f"{a} % {b} = {modulus}")
print(f"{a} ** {b} = {exponent}")

# Operations with assignment
x = 5
x += 3  # x = x + 3, result is x = 8
x *= 2  # x = x * 2, result is x = 16
print(f"Current value of x: {x}")`
  }]}
/>

## Practical Exercises

Let's try some simple exercises to practice what we've learned:

### Simple Calculator

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "calculator.py",
    code: `# Simple calculator
print("=== SIMPLE CALCULATOR ===")

# Input from user
number1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
operator = input("Enter operator (+, -, *, /): ")
number2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

# Calculation process
if operator == "+":
    result = number1 + number2
elif operator == "-":
    result = number1 - number2
elif operator == "*":
    result = number1 * number2
elif operator == "/":
    if number2 != 0:
        result = number1 / number2
    else:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero!")
        result = None
else:
    print("Invalid operator!")
    result = None

# Output result
if result is not None:
    print(f"Result: {number1} {operator} {number2} = {result}")`
  }]}
/>

### Temperature Conversion

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "temperature_converter.py",
    code: `# Temperature converter from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin
print("=== TEMPERATURE CONVERTER ===")

# Input temperature in Celsius
celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in Celsius: "))

# Convert to Fahrenheit and Kelvin
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
kelvin = celsius + 273.15

# Output conversion results
print(f"\nConversion results from {celsius}°C:")
print(f"Fahrenheit: {fahrenheit:.1f}°F")
print(f"Kelvin: {kelvin:.1f}K")

# Bonus: Additional information
if celsius < 0:
    print("This temperature is below water freezing point!")
elif celsius == 0:
    print("This temperature is water freezing point!")
elif celsius == 100:
    print("This temperature is water boiling point!")
elif celsius > 100:
    print("This temperature is above water boiling point!")`
  }]}
/>

### Student Profile

<CodeBlock 
  data={[{
    language: "python",
    filename: "personal_info.py",
    code: `# Program to collect and display personal information
print("=== STUDENT PROFILE ===")

# Input information
name = input("Full name: ")
student_id = input("Student ID: ")
major = input("Major: ")
semester = int(input("Semester: "))
hobby = input("Favorite hobby: ")

# Calculate additional information
entry_year = 2025 - (semester - 1) // 2
estimated_graduation = entry_year + 4

# Display complete profile
print("\n" + "="*40)
print("STUDENT PROFILE")
print("="*40)
print(f"Name        : {name}")
print(f"Student ID  : {student_id}")
print(f"Major       : {major}")
print(f"Semester    : {semester}")
print(f"Hobby       : {hobby}")
print(f"Entry Year  : {entry_year}")
print(f"Est. Graduation: {estimated_graduation}")
print("="*40)

# Motivational message
if semester <= 2:
    print("Good luck at the beginning of your studies!")
elif semester <= 6:
    print("Keep up your learning spirit!")
else:
    print("Good luck finishing your studies!")`
  }]}

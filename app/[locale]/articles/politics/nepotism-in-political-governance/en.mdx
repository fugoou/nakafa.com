## Abstract

The aim of this study is to examine the dynamics of nepotism within the democratic system of Indonesia.
Through secondary research drawn from various scholarly sources, it has been found that the practice of
nepotism remains deeply entrenched within the layers of contemporary political and governmental aspects.
Nepotism, having become a cultural norm, poses a formidable challenge due to the various risks it entails.
Issues such as corruption and the erosion of public trust resulting from weak governmental oversight are
attributed to the persistent erosion of the democratic system by nepotism. The emergence of the term
"Dynastic Politics" during President Jokowi's era has also sparked controversy, further seasoning the
practice of nepotism in Indonesia.

## Introduction

Personal interests rooted in conflicts of interest are regarded as nepotism. Nepotism emerges as a
hidden threat in public decision-making due to the presence of personal interests leading to conflicts.
Providing actual benefits to family members within the same organization also constitutes a form of
nepotism. A hallmark representing nepotism is the presence of family members within the same
organization (Tytko et al., 2020). According to Padgett & Morris (2005), nepotism takes two forms:
hereditary nepotism and matrimonial nepotism. Hereditary nepotism is referred to as intergenerational
nepotism and involves the appointment of family members and relatives to political positions.
Meanwhile, matrimonial nepotism, also known as marital nepotism, refers to the appointment of one spouse
to perform the same job when the other spouse is already employed in the same field. Regarding its
scope, according to Gjinovci & Gjinovci (2017), nepotism occurs in various fields including political
nepotism, familial nepotism, organizational nepotism, and employment-related nepotism.

## Problem Statement

The act of nepotism is considered perilous, particularly in the appointment of government officials, as the
potential for corruption and abuse of authority is significantly heightened. Moreover, nepotism is seen as
the precursor to the abuse of power for personal gain, leading to an increased likelihood of engaging in
corruption (Siegert A, 2008). This personal gain refers to favoring genetic relatives over non-family members,
regardless of their professional background and achievements. In some countries adhering to non-democratic systems,
nepotism is prevalent due to the concentration of power within individuals or small groups. How does this phenomenon
manifest in countries like Indonesia, which adhere to a democratic system?

## Observing Nepotism During The Reformasi Era

In essence, as a democratic state, the practice of nepotism can be restricted or even eradicated. However,
the prevailing reality indicates that nepotism has become a deeply rooted cultural norm permeating every
stratum of society. The proliferation of nepotism, coupled with corruption and collusion in Indonesia, emerged
during the authoritarian the New Order (Orde Baru) regime (Ismansyah & Sulistyo, 2010). Following the end of
the New Order era, it became evident that the practices of nepotism, corruption, and collusion had become
entrenched traditions in Indonesia, marked by low levels of good governance quality. This assertion is
supported by research conducted by Huther & Shah (1998), which used Indonesia as one of the samples in
their study conducted in 1998 regarding the quality of good governance in Asian countries. The study revealed
that Indonesia was categorized as having poor governance. This categorization was determined based on the
government quality index, which measures the efficiency of the judiciary, corruption index, and good governance
index.

## Abstract

Indonesia's sugar industry has been in decline since the significant increase in imports year after year. 
This study discusses the sugar industry in Indonesia, starting from its history to its development in the import-export market. 
Using a descriptive analysis method based on various sources, it concludes that Indonesia's dependency on sugar imports remains significantly high to this day.

## Introduction

Thomas Trikasih Lembong, an entrepreneur and former Indonesian Minister of Trade for the 2015–2016 term, 
was named a suspect by the Attorney General's Office in a corruption case involving sugar imports. 
This alleged misconduct occurred during his tenure as Minister of Trade. Before being declared a suspect, 
Thomas Lembong was one of the witnesses in the case. The Business Development Director of PT 
Perusahaan Perdagangan Indonesia (PPI) for the 2015–2016 period was another witness who was eventually named a suspect. 
This corruption case revolved around sugar imports triggered by a shortage of white crystal sugar in Indonesia in 2016 (BBC News Indonesia, 2024).

The Ministry of Economic Affairs' announcement of a sugar shortage in Indonesia prompted the Business Development 
Director of PPI to instruct subordinates to hold meetings with private companies in the sugar sector. 
The aim of these meetings was to address the sugar scarcity issue. A total of eight companies—PT PDSU, 
PT AF, PT AP, PT MT, PT BMM, PT SUJ, PT DSI, and PT MSI—attended the meetings organized by PPI to discuss 
how to meet the demand for white crystal sugar in Indonesia (Mumpuni, 2024). However, the issue lies in the existing regulations, 
which state that the need for white crystal sugar should be fulfilled by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through imports, 
not by private entities. Furthermore, according to the BBC, the import in question involved raw sugar, not white crystal sugar, which was the item in deficit.

The importation of raw sugar by the Minister of Trade raised significant concerns. The raw sugar was processed by 
companies authorized only to produce refined sugar and was subsequently sold at $\text{Rp}16.000$, seemingly purchased by PPI. 
At the time, the maximum retail price of white crystal sugar was set at $\text{Rp}13.000$. This discrepancy led to state losses 
amounting to $\text{Rp}400\text{ billion}$ (Dyah Wahyuningtyas & Pratiwi, 2024). The sugar imports in Indonesia during 2015–2016 
indicate that the state of the sugar commodity market requires deeper analysis. For Indonesians, sugar has become 
an essential and irreplaceable staple. This is evident in the nation's cultural inclination towards sweetness, 
exemplified by the habit of consuming and serving sweet drinks to guests. However, as seen in 2015–2016, 
there was a significant imbalance between production and consumption in Indonesia's sugar industry. 
This study explores the current state of Indonesia's sugar market and the factors driving the nation to continue importing sugar from other countries.

## The History of Sugar as a Food Commodity in Indonesia

A commodity is considered a staple food if it meets six criteria outlined in the Indonesian Food Law No. 18/2012. 
These criteria are the share of household food expenditure, contribution to carbohydrates, protein consumption, 
frequency of consumption, contribution to vitamins and minerals, and the share of domestic production to consumption. 
Sugar has become the seventh staple food for Indonesians after rice, chicken eggs, tofu and tempeh, broiler chicken meat, 
fresh mackerel, and fresh milkfish. Sugar production in Indonesia dates back to the Dutch colonial era, 
which marked the introduction of sugarcane as its primary raw material. During the 1930s, Indonesia became the 
world's second-largest sugar exporter, with production reaching $3\text{ million }\text{tons}$. At its peak, $179$ sugar factories 
(PG) were operational, achieving productivity levels of around $14.80\%$ and a yield between $11\%$ and $13.80\%$. Of the 
total sugar production, $2.4 \text{ million }\text{tons}$ were exported. Factors contributing to this success included access to 
fertile land, cheap labor, prioritized irrigation, and disciplined technological application.

However, between 1989 and 1999, Indonesia's sugar industry faced serious challenges. A notable issue was the sharp increase in import volumes, 
which grew by $21.62\%$ annually, compared to a growth rate of only $0.98\%$ per year during the previous decade. By 1967, Indonesia had transitioned 
from being a sugar exporter to a sugar importer, and today it stands as one of the largest sugar-importing nations. 
The evolution of the sugar industry reflects a broader trend where countries shift roles from exporters to importers and vice versa (Mudzofar & Bowo, 2018).

Sugar is a product derived from sugarcane, available in various types such as white crystal sugar (GKP), raw sugar (GKM), and refined sugar (GKR). 
These classifications follow the standards set by the International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis (ICUMSA), an organization 
analyzing sugar quality with member countries from around the world. According to ICUMSA standards, the whiter the sugar, the lower its ICUMSA 
value on an international scale. Additionally, the World Trade Organization (WTO) categorizes sugar as a special commodity alongside rice, corn, 
and soybeans. In Indonesia, sugar serves as one of the primary food commodities, fulfilling the population's caloric needs and acting as the main 
ingredient in artificial sweeteners for processed food and beverage industries consumed daily. Therefore, sugar is a staple for people of all age 
groups and social classes. The state of a country's sugar industry is often a key indicator of its food security (Supriyati, 2016).

Sugar production in Indonesia is significantly linked to imports, but consumption levels also warrant attention. A USDA report from 2023 
revealed that sugar consumption in Indonesia reached $7.9 \text{ million } \text{tons}$, while domestic sugar production was only around $2.6 \text{ million } \text{tons}$. 
To bridge the gap, $5.3 \text{ million } \text{tons}$ of sugar had to be imported to meet national demand. The dynamics of the global sugar trade heavily 
influence Indonesia's position as a net global importer. In 2023, global sugar prices surged. Export restrictions imposed by major sugar-exporting 
countries in 2022–2023 further exacerbated the rise in granulated sugar prices. According to the International Sugar Organization (ISO), 
sugar demand in Indonesia increases by an average of $4\%$ annually, driven by the needs of its approximately $260\text{ million}$ population 
(Ramadani et al., 2024). If the sugar business in Indonesia does not undergo significant changes, the sugar supply deficit will persist 
and expand yearly, owing to rising local demand and limited local production. Below is a comparison of sugar industry consumption and 
production levels in Indonesia (BPS, 2019).

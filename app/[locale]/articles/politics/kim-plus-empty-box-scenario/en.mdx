## Electability Doesn't Guarantee, Political Interests Take Priority

Jakarta, as a barometer of democracy for other regions, is under the spotlight ahead of the 2024 Governor Election,
with several aspects highlighting the dynamic nature of its political landscape. Political maneuvers for the 2024
Regional Election have been noticeable since the 2024 General Election. The prospective candidates who were
expected to compete in this contest turned out not to match the expectations and the surveys that had been discussed.
Based on a survey (INDIKATOR, 2024), the leading candidate for Jakarta Governor in the 2024 Regional Election
is Anies Baswedan, with 39.7% of the votes. He is followed by Ahok with 23.8%, and Ridwan Kamil with 13.1%.
However, as of August 19, 2024, only Ridwan Kamil has been officially declared as a candidate for Jakarta Governor, paired with Suswono.

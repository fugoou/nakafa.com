## Abstract

This research is conducted qualitatively through secondary sources from various previous studies and reports
from various related institutions to analyze the pork barrel political agenda that is indicated to be carried
out ahead of the 2024 election and explain how this pork barrel political agenda is carried out for certain
political purposes. The involvement of the social assistance budget as a weapon used in carrying out this
political agenda becomes a more specific discussion regarding the type of policy of pork barrel politics.
Findings related to the effectiveness of this strategy in creating vote barns are also described in this research.

## Introduction

Politics in relation to power definitely requires a strategy for framing the flow of the process to achieve
political goals. Politicians use different strategies in planning their political direction. These strategies
do not only include black and white policies that can be distinguished by the general public.
In addition, many political actors use grey political schemes. This scheme can be identified as a strategy
that looks right and does not violate any rules, but at the same time, the goals to be achieved have been
contaminated with personal interests that are carried out above public policy. The term pork barrel
politics is appropriate for this scheme. More specifically, pork barrel politics involves government
projects that are targeted at specific geographical areas. These activities are directed at the public and
funded with public money in the hope that the public will provide political support to certain candidates (Marasabessy & Siagian, 2024).

This political scheme is part of a populist program resulting from the existence of dynasty politics
built on the basis of paternalistic relationships (Djati, 2013). This "paternalistic" relationship
refers to a dynamic akin to that of a father and child, wherein protection and benefits are provided
to individuals who support the authoritative figure. This power relationship is facilitated through
the redistribution of public funds by local political dynasties to garner political support. Such
distribution is termed as the redistribution of populist programs, where political leaders utilize
these funds to finance projects deemed popular or appealing to the public, such as infrastructure
development, welfare programs, or social assistance. Through this redistribution, political leaders
aim to strengthen their support base among voters and maintain their power in the long term (Grossman & Helpman, 2022).
It is also elucidated in a study (Rantau et al., 2019) concerning pork barrel political policies. This policy
directs the pattern of resource distribution by focusing on specific regions that serve as electoral bases or
are expected to become electoral bases for election participants, whether individual candidates or
political parties. The term "Pork Barrel" was first introduced by John A. Ferejohn in his work titled
"Pork Barrel Politics: Rivers and Harbors Legislation, 1947-1968" to refer to the phenomenon of distributing
state resources for the purpose of gaining victories in the United States Congress.

Discussing pork barrel politics, this scheme is closely related to patronage politics. Patronage politics is a
political relationship that relies on money, goods, or economic opportunities being distributed to gain
political support (Rumambi, 2019). Political pork barrels are part of patronage politics focused on government
projects targeted at specific geographic regions (Dalupe, 2020). Unlike money politics, which emphasizes the
practice of giving money or other resources for specific purposes, such as supporting particular political
interests, this practice may also include buying votes from voters by offering material rewards. Money politics
can involve cash, but sometimes it also entails assistance in the form of physical facilities or other support
for a specific candidate's campaign (Marasabessy & Siagian, 2024).

## Problem Statement

The political dynamics that occur make politicians use various strategies to achieve their political goals.
Political capital is used to produce political actions that are beneficial and can strengthen the position of
the political actors or political institutions concerned. Pork barrel politics is one of the politicians'
strategies for strengthening their influence to gain many votes and support in a political competition.
The widespread use of this strategy, which is organized through policies that concern the community in
certain areas, creates its own consensus to be researched. This leads to the question, "How does the pork
barrel political strategy navigate within the political landscape of Indonesia?" Furthermore, an analysis
concerning the effectiveness of the political strategy also becomes a necessary component of this political study.

## Why Does Social Assistance Funding Become a Weapon in Executing This Strategy?

The emergence of new policies in the run-up to elections is often associated with pork barrel political
strategies by incumbents to maintain their position in the next election contest. Often, they utilize
fiscal policies that release budgets during the election period to influence voters by making policies such
as investment projects in certain areas, spending budgets targeted at certain groups, and making tax cuts
aimed at benefiting certain parties (Drazen & Eslava, 2006). Policy funds, or discretionary funds, are budgets
that tend to be used by regional heads who have plans to run for re-election in the next regional head contest.
The use of policy funds is based on Permendagri Number 21/2011, which includes the allocation of grant and
social assistance expenditures. Both are part of the indirect expenditure category, whose allocation basis
tends to be subjective because it is not based on specific targets. This makes these two budgets a weapon for
politicians to carry out pork barrel political strategies in the period leading up to the election (Pratiwi & Nasution, 2022).
The indicator for the utilization of the pork barrel strategy is the utilization of grant and social
assistance expenditure budgets, observed through the difference in the allocation of grant and social
assistance budgets before and during the election period. This aligns with research conducted by Ritonga & Alam (2010),
which concludes that there is an increase in the ratio of grant and social assistance budgets to
total expenditure in regions where the regional leaders are running for re-election as incumbents
compared to regions where the regional leaders are not running for re-election in that area as non-incumbents.

## Tracing the Main Holders of Pork Barrel Political Strategy Actors

The condition of leaders with incumbent status tends to do a lot of Pork Barrel politics, according to
John Ferejohn's research (Wilk, 2010), there are 3 reasons underlying this statement. First, using pork
barrel politics will give the impression that the perpetrator has helped by bringing projects to the place
he leads, which will help the sustainability of his campaign. Second, pork barrel politics can improve the
political image of incumbent candidates as leaders who prioritize the interests of their constituents.
This condition can provide greater opportunities than those of other political opponents. Third, they
have the opportunity to control laws and regulations that they think can benefit them and can control
project policies in their constituencies. Egoism in the familial relationship in government politics is
also the cause of this pork barrel strategy. This is because the direction of egoism tends to keep
certain families in power. Therefore, political dynasties in government based on family relationships
have a considerable influence on the pork barrel policy to foster and strengthen the social cohesion of
the ruler with the community (Gunanto, 2020). So that leaders who are found to be running for re-election
in the next election and leaders who are indicated to have a familial relationship with the next leader,
according to John Frejohn in Wilk (2010) and Gunnantoanto (2020), tend to try to carry out this pork barrel political strategy.

## Understanding the Characteristics of Pork Barrel Politics

According to research by Wilk (2010) and Gunanto (2020), parties that already have power are more
likely to use "pork barrel" politics. This is because incumbent leaders and leaders who are likely
to be part of a political dynasty are the ones who use policy funds to carry out these kinds of
political strategies. Shedding light on political dynasties in Indonesia, familial relationships
still strongly influence the hierarchy of government and politics at both the regional and national
levels. At the national level, under President Jokowi, political dynasty is considered to have
started with the ascent of Gibran Rakabuming Raka as mayor of Solo in 2020 and as a vice presidential
candidate in 2024 (Dona, 2022). Delving into the phenomenon of political dynasties can provide an
example of how the mechanism of the pork barrel is carried out. In the study by Saragintan & Hidayat (2017),
the characteristics of pork barrel policies are explained. These characteristics include:

1. Conducted by a government leader, especially one facing an election, with the aim of gaining support and being re-elected.
2. Using the state budget, which is usually channeled through government programmes and allocation of funds from the central government to the regions.
3. Regionally-oriented or territorial in nature, where fund allocations are targeted only to assist a specific group of people within a particular region.
4. Pork barrel politics is regionally focused or confined to specific spatial contexts, so only certain communities can benefit from the allocation of funds.
5. The practice does not bind constituents to vote for the incumbent, as assistance is generally provided before the election without a formal agreement.

## Identifying the Politicization of Social Assistance Funds as Pork Barrel Politics

Based on the characteristics mentioned, we can trace one by one the indications of pork barrel
politics in Indonesia. The 2024 election contest announced Gibran Rakabuming Raka as a vice presidential
candidate alongside Prabowo Subianto, creating significant questions for some sectors of society
regarding political dynasties (Bintang et al., 2023). Jokowi, as the president of Indonesia and
the holder of government power, has the opportunity to intervene in the continuity of the 2024 election process.
In distributive politics, according to Stokes (2013), rulers or incumbents have an advantage
because they have access to resources sourced from the government. They are also closer to the
people because the government interacts directly with them through government programmes.
In addition, as executors of government programmes, incumbents also act as actors who conduct direct
transactions with the community. In accordance with the first characteristic of pork barrel political policy,
it is carried out by a government leader, especially those who will face general elections, with the aim of
gaining support and being re-elected. Therefore, this condition is in line with the first characteristic described.

Related to the second characteristic, which is the practice of pork barrel politics utilizing state budget
usually channeled through government programs and fund allocations from the central to local levels, it can
be associated with the increase in social protection budget preceding the 2024 election. The rise in the
social protection budget in 2024, as outlined in the State Budget Report (Kemenkeu RI, 2024a) prior
to the election, serves as an initial indication of pork barrel politics carried out by Jokowi to maintain
his support base. This is also confirmed by a statement from Jusuf Kalla, Vice President of the Republic
of Indonesia for the 2014–2019 period, agreeing with the allegations of political content in the distribution
of social assistance funds, especially seeing the trend of increasing social assistance funds closer
to election time, both at the national and local levels. One of the main reasons for the utilization
of grant and social assistance programs for the benefit of specific political actors is the populist nature
of these programs, which are often exploited for political gain in general elections,
whether at the national or local level (Rahmanto et al., 2021).

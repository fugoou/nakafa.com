## What Is a Vector?

To understand vectors, imagine a weather map showing wind direction and speed at various locations. On such maps, arrows are often drawn. These arrows indicate the **direction** of the wind and **how strong** it blows (usually shown by the length or thickness of the arrow).

In mathematics, quantities that have both **magnitude (size)** and **direction** like this are called **vectors**. Thus, the speed and direction of wind on a weather map is a good example of a vector. The length of the arrow represents the _magnitude_ of the wind speed (for example, 30 km/h), and the direction of the arrow shows the _direction_ in which it blows.

## Drawing and Writing Vectors

Vectors are typically drawn as directed line segments (arrows).

- **Vector 1**: Direction of the vector from point <InlineMath math="(0, 0)" /> to point <InlineMath math="(6, 8)" />
- **Vector 2**: Direction of the vector from point <InlineMath math="(5, 2)" /> to point <InlineMath math="(1, 1)" />
- **Vector 3**: Direction of the vector from point <InlineMath math="(4, 7)" /> to point <InlineMath math="(2, 0)" />

### Key Components of Vectors

1.  **Initial Point:** The starting point of the vector.
2.  **Terminal Point:** The ending point of the vector, marked with an arrowhead.
3.  **Magnitude:** The length of the arrow, representing the value or size of the vector. Often also called _vector length_. The length of vector <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB}" /> is denoted as <InlineMath math="|\overrightarrow{AB}|" />.
4.  **Direction:** The direction pointed by the arrowhead.

### Vector Notation

There are several ways to write vectors:

1.  **Two Capital Letters with an Arrow Above:** Indicating the initial and terminal points. Example: <InlineMath math="\overrightarrow{AB}" />, meaning a vector from point A to point B.
2.  **One Lowercase Letter with an Arrow Above:** Example: <InlineMath math="\vec{a}" />.
3.  **Bold Letters:** Example: **a** or **AB**
